With a strong focus on manual testing, I conduct System Testing (ST), User Acceptance Testing (UAT), Functional Testing, and Sanity Testing before and after moving to production (MTP). I primarily work on UI and proposal testing, ensuring that insurance policies and related outputs meet expected standards.
